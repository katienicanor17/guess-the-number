    <h1>Guess the number</h1>
    <p>This web page uses JS to prompts the user to guess a number between 0 and 10. Once the number is chosen, it will give the user feedback like 'higher', 'lower', or 'Got it!' in which case the user wins! It also keeps track of how many guesses the user took. </p>

        To increment counter do this:
        counter++;
